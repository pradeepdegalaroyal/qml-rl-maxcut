Quantum-inspired RL optimization for Max-Cut using QAOA. Built with Qiskit, Python, and CLI tools for ML research

# QML/RL-Inspired Max-Cut Optimization with QAOA

## Overview
This project implements the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve the Max-Cut problem on a 4-node graph, inspired by reinforcement learning (RL) principles. The iterative parameter tuning mimics RL policy optimization, aligning with quantum-inspired machine learning (QML) for optimization tasks. Built with Qiskit, NumPy, NetworkX, and Matplotlib; supports CLI execution and visualization.

## Features
- **QML/RL Integration**: QAOAâ€™s variational approach mirrors RL policy updates for optimization.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Constructs adjacency matrix for quantum operators using NumPy.
- **Visualization**: Generates Max-Cut solution plots with Matplotlib.
- **CLI Support**: Customizable parameters via command-line interface (e.g., `--nodes`).
